# SDO-EVE Science Data Processing Code

## Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics

This repo contains code for science data processing of data from the EVE (EUV Variability Experiment) instrument aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). 

Data can be accessed from the [SDO-EVE data access website](https://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/data_access/index.html). Specifically, directory access for the different level data products is [here](https://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/data_access/eve_data/products/). Note that in the directory for each level, there is a README that explains the data format and provides example usage.
